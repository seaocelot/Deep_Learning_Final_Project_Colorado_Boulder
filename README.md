Above is the Jupyter Notebook for my final project for Introduction to Deep Learning at the University of Colorado Boulder. The final project is the development of a neural network model that classifies mushrooms as either edible or poisonous.
Also included is a csv file containing the mushrooms data: predictor variables and response variable. The mushrooms data was obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The data was called in as two pandas dataframes
that were part of a python Dotdict data structure. One dataframe contained the predictor variables and the other dataframe contained the response variable. The two pandas dataframes were combined and then converted to a csv file.
The citation for the mushrooms data is: "Mushroom." UCI Machine Learning Repository, 1981, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom
